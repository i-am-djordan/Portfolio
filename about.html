            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> 
                Hi, I am Destiny Jordan, but call me DJ. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan - Flint and majoring in Software Engineering.
                In university, I am enrolled in a Bachelor to Master's program, which allows me to complete my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and then continue on to a Master's degree in the same field.
                I was also dual enrolled during high school so I've been able to take college courses early, which has given me a head start in my education.
                I really enjoy learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of software engineering and hope to apply what I learn in my future career.
                I have a passion for Front End Development and Software Engineering. I enjoy creating web applications and learning new technologies.
                Even though I am still a student, I have been able to gain some experience in the field through my coursework and personal projects.
                I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career.
                In my free time, I enjoy creating projects, crocheting, and spending time with my family and friends.
                I also love taking care of my plants and watching them grow.
                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I hope to connect with you and share my journey in software engineering.
